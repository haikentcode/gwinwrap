## Why is it better than normal wallpaper? ##
Xwinwrap allows you to set a screensaver or video as the wallpaper, which can be either painful for your eyes or pleasant, depending on the screensaver settings or the video.

Since xwinwrap is confusing to anyone not familiar with it, Gwinwrap attempts to simplify the process of picking out a screensaver or movie to use, and includes sane defaults that won't kill your eyes.

## Why would I want to have a video running in the background on my desktop? ##
If you can find a video of something simple like a fish tank, that loops without a skip, it might be a relaxing background. It's up to you. If you want to annoy your friends with a rick-roll background, be my guest.

## When I use gwinwrap, my desktop icons disappear. ##
Unfortunately, xwinwrap (and thus gwinwrap) draws above your desktop icons, making them invisible. To fix this, change the opacity to something less than 100% or move your icons to another folder to use. Sorry about this, but it is not something I can fix--I don't code xwinwrap.

## Gwinwrap's effects don't work--the effect flickers terribly, and is above the desktop! ##
Unfortunately, some linux graphics card drivers are problematic for graphics (such as videos and 3d animation). Since the graphics are managed by the drivers, I have no control over this problem. Sorry!

The computer I have tested that produces these unfavorable effects is the Dell Latitude D630 laptop.

## Won't this make my computer slower? ##
As long as you use the low cpu priority setting, running xwinwrap through Gwinwrap should not slow down your computer visibly. If you are running folding@home, however, this is not the program for you.

## What if I want to keep my desktop simple? ##
If this is the case, you probably won't want to use xwinwrap or gwinwrap.
